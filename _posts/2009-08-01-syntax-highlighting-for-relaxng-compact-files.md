title: "Syntax highlighting for Relax NG Compact files [2009-08-01]"
---

*Update August 2011.
This highlighting file has now been merged into Kate: <https://cgit.kde.org/kate.git/commit/?id=377b90dd5d827764e70a91eeff0897831e1f6897>*

During my work on documenting the [Citation Style Language](http://xbiblio.sourceforge.net/) (CSL), I wrote a Relax NG Compact-syntax-highlighting file for use with KDE's text editor [Kate](http://kate-editor.org/kate) and [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
I [requested](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202187) for it to be included in KDE, but for now it's at least available here.
