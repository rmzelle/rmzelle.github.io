Welcome to my personal website. Disappointed by our heavy reliance on information silos like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, I decided to (finally) register my own domain and stake out a place on the internet. Long live the Indie Web!

Since 2006 I've been active in my professional life as a researcher in the field of metabolic engineering and microbial physiology, with a heavy focus on *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (or baker's yeast). During my PhD studies I encountered the reference manager Zotero, and after making some modest contributions, I quickly rolled into development of the Citation Style Language (CSL), another open source project. I played an important role in its 1.0 and 1.0.1 releases, and continue to shepherd the project as my spare time allows.
